overview: "This 1-hour BoF session, [Developing a Sustainable Future for HPC and RSE Skills: Training Pathways and Structures](https://app.swapcard.com/widget/event/isc-high-performance-2024/planning/UGxhbm5pbmdfMTgyNjc4OA==), was run during the 2024 [ISC-HPC conference](https://www.isc-hpc.com/) in Hamburg, Germany by two members of the UNIVERSE-HPC project team. The session was proposed and developed by a wider group of 6 international collaborators to look at how we build training pathways and structures to effectively support technical professionals.<br/><br/>As part of the session, a pen-and-paper exercise was undertaken using a sheet containing a skills space based on the [HPC Certification Forum's skill tree](https://www.hpc-certification.org/cs/#skill-tree). Attendees were invited to use this <a href=\"..//assets/slides/ISC24PathwaysBoF-DesignYourPathwayExerciseSheet-A3.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exercise sheet</a> to illustrate a learning pathway of their choice."
