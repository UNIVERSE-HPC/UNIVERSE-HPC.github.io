This session will look Property-based Testing using Python. This is a form of
automated testing that applies a range of values to key properties to try and
identify failure cases in your code. For a much more detailed discussion of
what property based testing is (and isn't!), take a look at [this
article](https://hypothesis.works/articles/what-is-property-based-testing/). 

The session will provide a general introduction to the topic followed by an
interactive tutorial where you'll have a chance to try out writing your own
tests. Please note that to participate in the interactive part of the session,
you'll need Python installed on your computer and be able to add new Python
libraries with the `pip` package management tool. We'll do this via a virtual
environment so you won't require admin access if you have Python, `pip` and
`venv` available. We also recommend that you some basic familiarity with
writing tests in Python via Python's `unittest` framework, `pytest` or a
similar testing library.
