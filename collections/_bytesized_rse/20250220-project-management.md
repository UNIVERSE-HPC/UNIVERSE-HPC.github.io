This session explores different approaches to project management and introduces the features of GitHub that can support project management. Some of these will be familiar to GitHub users, like repositories and issues, but some may not be, like projects and milestones You will learn how to create project boards from templates and adapt them to your own and your team's needs, explore different board views, and automate task management. Sophia will do a live demonstration of these features and you'll then have a chance to get your hands dirty and work on your own project boards!

**Prerequisites**: Attendees should be familiar with GitHub and have a GitHub account.
