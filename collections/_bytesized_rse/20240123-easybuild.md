This session will provide a high-level introduction to the software build
and installation framework EasyBuild (https://easybuild.io/).

EasyBuild is focused on supporting the installation of software on High
Performance Computing (HPC) platforms and is increasingly widely used as a
tool to simplify this process. Following a short introductory presentation,
there will be an opportunity to see how EasyBuild works as part of a
hands-on interactive tutorial.

<em>Please note the prerequisites (detailed on the <a href="https://forms.gle/WPb3XMigY86PjdqQ9"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sign-up form</a>) for participating
in the interactive part of this session - you may need to find a suitable
Linux-based platform on which to undertake the tutorial and install some
required software dependencies.</em>
