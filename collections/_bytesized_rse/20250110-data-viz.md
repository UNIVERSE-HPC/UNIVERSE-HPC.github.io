In the second episode of season 3 of byte-sized RSE, we'll be looking at how to create clear and effective data visualisations, that take into account how human perception works. Data visualisations take data and turn them into pictures. How those pictures, and by extension the data, are understood will be affected by the ways that the human visual system interprets the world. In the first part of the session, you will learn about relevant visual illusions, visual variables, and Gestalt principles that you should be aware of when creating your plots. In the second part of the session, you will get some hands-on experience with improving data visualisations that disregard the principles covered in the first session.

**Prerequisites**: In order to be able to participate in the practical/interactive part of this session, youâ€™ll need to be comfortable creating visualisations in the programming language of your choice. Demonstrations will be done using R and the ggplot2 package.
