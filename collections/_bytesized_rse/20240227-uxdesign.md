This session will provide an introduction to UX Design.

UX design is the process of creating the experience a user would go
through when interacting with your application. It is so much more than
the visual aesthetic, it encompasses usability, usefulness and overall
performance. This interactive session will look at two important UX design
skills. Firstly we will take a scenario from an initial design, through end
user input and context of use. Secondly we will explore the impact of UX
design choices in the tech around us as a way of understanding the
consequences of the design decisions we make.
