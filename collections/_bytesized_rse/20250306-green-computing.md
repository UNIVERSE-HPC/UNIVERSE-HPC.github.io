As the environmental impact of computational research grows, understanding and reducing the carbon footprint of research software is becoming increasingly important. This session will explore how researchers can assess and calculate the carbon emissions associated with their software and computational workflows. 

The session will introduce the GREENER principles - a set of guidelines for environmentally sustainable computational science - which are aimed at helping participants to make informed decisions about energy-efficient computing practices.  It will also outline key terms and challenges in reducing the environmental impact of digital research.

In the practical session, participants will work with the Green Algorithms online tool, they will be guided through using it to calculate and compare the carbon footprint of various computational tasks. By the end of the session, attendees will have the knowledge and skills to use the tool for their own workflows.
