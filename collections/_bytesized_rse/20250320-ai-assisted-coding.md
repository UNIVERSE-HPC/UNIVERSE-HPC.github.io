This session will be led by Dr Chris Cooling, a Senior Teaching Fellow from the Early Career Researcher Institute at Imperial College London.

Generative AI is impacting many workflows in academia and industry, including programming. This hands-on  session gives an introduction to GitHub Copilot which is one of the leading tools for assisting with the writing of code. Attendees will be introduced to the tool and its interface, before seeing how to use it to examine existing code, modify existing code and develop new code. There will be time for hands-on experience through guided exercises and follow-along examples.

**Prerequisites**: Participants will need a [**GitHub** account](https://github.com/). If you are eligible, you may want to sign up for [GitHub Education](https://github.com/education) to receive the Pro version of GitHub Copilot (registration can take up to 10 days), although the Free version will be sufficient for participating in this session. The session will use basic **Python** for its examples, so foundational knowledge of Python would be an advantage to attendees.
