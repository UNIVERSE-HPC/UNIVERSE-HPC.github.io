### [Register now](https://forms.office.com/e/ysfdNKXaF2).

## Overview:

- üïí **Friday 12th April** 2024, **[10:00 - 16:30 BST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=UNIVERSE-HPC+Course+Materials+Hackathon&iso=20240712T10&p1=1233&ah=6&am=30)**
- üåç In person in Oxford and Online via Zoom

Following up on our successful first Hackathon, the UNIVERSE-HPC project team is organising another Hackathon to continue working on enhancing our course materials. Anyone with an interest in training for RSEs is welcome - no need to have joined the previous Hackathon to join us for this one üíñ

We will focus our activity on two strands that you can get involved in and contribute to:

- **Infrastructure**, enhancing/extending/contributing to Gutenberg, our new training platform. One of the likely foci is making Gutenberg more accessible.
- **Pedagogy**, implementing good educational principles in the lessons. One of the likely activities will be to move over the lesson objectives we collated last time into the actual lessons.

For people who did not attend the previous Hackathon, this will be a fantastic opportunity to learn about using and deploying Gutenberg, an open-source teaching platform developed at the University of Oxford, that you could use in your own teaching. Gutenberg uses course materials written in Markdown and offers the features of a learning management system, for example, giving access to a specific group of enrolled students and tracking their progress through a course. Have a look at an example deployment from Oxford: https://train.oxrse.uk/material.
