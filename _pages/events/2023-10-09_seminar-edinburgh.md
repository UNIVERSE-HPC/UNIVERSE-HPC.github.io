## Structure and delivery format for Online HPC courses

**Join us for the first UNIVERSE-HPC seminar on Monday 9th October 2023 at
11:30am**. This is a hybrid event and you can join us online or in person at The Bayes Centre, University of Edinburgh.

### Registration Closed

## Overview:
With the rapid move to widescale use of online training kickstarted by the COVID pandemic, there has been a lot of discussion about the best technologies to use for the delivery of lectures and practicals for remote courses, but surprisingly little discussion about the high-level structure such as timetabling. In this talk, Dr David Henty will discuss the pros and cons of a variety of formats that EPCC has used for online training before, during and after the pandemic.

## Schedule
- Welcome & Introduction by UNIVERSE-HPC PI, Neil Chue Hong: 11:30am - 11:45am
- Main talk by David Henty: 11:45am - 12:45pm
- Q&A: 12:45 - 1:00pm
- Lunch at Main Atrium: 1pm - 2pm

**Registration deadline for in-person attendance:** Sunday 8th October 2023
