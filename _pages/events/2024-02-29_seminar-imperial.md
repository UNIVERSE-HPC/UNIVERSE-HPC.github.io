This talk will walk you through a series of educational examples where programmes such as summer schools, live workshops, term-long courses, longitudinal programmes and others, have changed tack post-pandemic, enabling more people to access learning opportunities on data science and AI. These examples will provide a starting point for open discussion with educators in the audience, aiming to share good practice and to draw inspiration from existing efforts to widen participation in education.
