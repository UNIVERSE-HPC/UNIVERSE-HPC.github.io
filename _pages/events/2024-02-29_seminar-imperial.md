This talk will walk you through a series of educational examples where programmes such as summer schools, live workshops, term-long courses, longitudinal programmes and others, have changed tack post-pandemic, enabling more people to access learning opportunities on data science and AI. These examples will provide a starting point for open discussion with educators in the audience, aiming to share good practice and to draw inspiration from existing efforts to widen participation in education.

**Speaker bio**: Mishka works at the intersection between AI, Skills and Education. She is interested in Responsible AI practices, deep-tech innovation within AI, as well in building human-centred open access products with the user communities at the very core. Mishka has a background in computational neuroscience & genetics and is most keen to bridge the gap & build connections between her interests and areas of expertise mentioned here.
